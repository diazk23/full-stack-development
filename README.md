# Intro to Client-Side JavaScript 

## This small project demonstrates modern JavaScript techniques:

- Use a JSON array as an in-memory data source (`Person` objects).
- Query and update the DOM using `querySelector`, `cloneNode`, and `textContent`.
- Handle events and forms to create, edit, and delete items dynamically.
- Small UI and focused so students can quickly inspect and modify the code.

## Files:

- `index.html` — HTML layout, a `<template>` for person cards, and links to CSS/JS.
- `css/styles.css` — Minimal styles to make the demo presentable.
- `js/main.js` — The interactive logic (in-memory JSON, render, add/edit/delete, search).

## How to use in class:

Serve `index.html` using http-server.
   npx http-server .

Add missing Javascript logic to `main.js`
